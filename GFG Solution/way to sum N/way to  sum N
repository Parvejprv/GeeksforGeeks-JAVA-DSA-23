Ways to sum to N
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 31.16%Submissions: 13K+Points: 4
Given a set of m distinct positive integers and a value ‘N’. Count the total number of ways we can form ‘N’ by  adding the array elements. Repetitions and different arrangements are allowed.
Note: Answer can be quite large output the answer modulo 109+7.

Example 1:

Input:
m = 3 , N = 7
Arr[] = {1,5,6}
Output: 6
Explanation: The different ways are:
1+1+1+1+1+1+1
1+1+5
1+5+1
5+1+1
1+6
6+1

â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
m = 3 , N = 3
Arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 4
Explanation: The different ways are:
1+1+1
1+2
2+1
3  

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countWays() which accepts array arr[], its size m and integer N and returns the total number of ways we can form ‘N’ by adding array elements.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*m)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= N , m <= 103






// number of ways to sum up to 'N' 
    int countWays(int arr[], int m, int N) 
    { 
      // Base case 
      if(N == 0) return 1;
      if(N < 0) return 0;
      
      
      int ans = 0;      // resultant var
      for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
          ans += countWays(arr, m, N-arr[i]);
      }
      return ans;
    }
